      I want to make a website for the podcast that my friends and I do every week. I would create a forum for our fans to post on, show notes with a bunch of information about the episodes, and clips of our favorite moments. It would help orginize the madness of the content we have created the past couple years and allow us to grow into a better show. I hope to create it (or at least start) all the front and back end aspects of the website.
